#borrowing this from https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex

#for this project, all files are named samplename_R1_001.fastq.gz or samplename_R2_001_fastq.gz

#which is cool because it means the first thing we have to do is make a list of file names

#first, need to make a list of sample names called (helpfully) "samples"

#ls *_R1_001.fastq.gz | cut -f1 -d "_" > samples
#this is how you'd do it if you have a useful delimiter between the sample name and the _fastq.gz component of your file name
#I, of course, have _ throughout the file name, so can't use this code. But theoretically, one could.
#anyway, I made a file called 'samples' that has all the sample names. Each sample name has both a fwd (R1) and rev (R2) fastq file.
#and now the below code should trim all those files.  


for sample in $(cat samples)
do

    echo "On sample: $sample"
